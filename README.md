# BOTDA Deconvolution
We present a novel high spatial resolution distributed fiber optic sensing algorithm for a high-precision infrastructure structure monitoring system

## Key Features
- **Enhanced High Spatial Resolution**: Achieves sub-meter resolution in BOTDA sensors using CNN technology without requiring hardware modifications.
- **Improved Measurement Efficiency and Accuracy**: Compared to traditional methods, CNN reduces measurement time and improves BFS measurement accuracy.
- **Flexible Adaptability**: The CNN model can adjust resolution as needed, making it suitable for various monitoring applicationsâ€‹.
